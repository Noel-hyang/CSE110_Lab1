I am currently studying at Sixth College of the University of California San Diego and studying computer science. One of the reasons I choose computer science as my major is that I am highly interested in technology. I always read tech news about computer components and how new tech might shape our features. I also like to learn how mechanical work. Of course, I don't always understand the mechanism, but I just enjoy to see how machines work. 
One of my favorite television show is **BattleBot**. In the show, people from all over the world bringing their own Battle Bots to fight for the championship. The new season is coming now, you have to watch! 
Also, I am an Anime fan. I am enjoying following the new series coming out each season.
I also like snowboarding. I am enjoying the speed and snow mountain cable car. If you also like snowboarding, feel free to team with me! (not hardcore snowboarding).
